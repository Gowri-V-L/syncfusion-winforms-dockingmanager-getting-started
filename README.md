# Winforms Docking Manager Getting Started
Getting Started with Syncfusion WinForms DockingManager

[WinForms DockingManager](https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/docking-manager) 

## Overview

The WinForms Docking Manager control provides an interface to create Visual Studio-like dockable windows in your applications. Dock panels support interactions like docking, floating, tabbing, auto hiding, and grouping document tabs. The control allows users to resize, move, and change the behavior of windows to create a layout that suits various development models.

## Different kinds of docking windows

Dockable windows can be dragged anywhere by users.  They can be floated around the screen, pinned, and unpinned. As in Visual Studio, the Docking Manager control offers different kinds of windows:

* Docking windows
* Floating windows
* Tabbed windows
* Pinnable windows
* Tabbed MDI windows 

## Restrict docking

Restrict windows from docking at specific sides of a target or at specific edges of a form. Also customize the dock hint visibility so that they are shown only on horizontal, vertical, or specific sides.

## Resizing windows

Users can utilize this interactive WinForms Docking Manager to resize windows by using a splitter between them. Resizing can be restricted within a minimum and maximum limit. 

## Redock to previous location

Built-in redock support saves the previous state of dock or float windows and moves the windows back to the state when the caption is double-clicked.

## Scroll tabs

The Docking Manager in WinForms can arrange groups of dock, float, and auto hide tabs. When the space is not sufficient to display all the tabs, users can view the tabs outside the viewport by scrolling or clicking the scroll buttons.

## Docking guides

Docking hints are displayed to indicate valid drop locations for docking panels while dragging the float window. Customize the appearance of the dock hints  with built-in styles.

## Context menu

The WinForms Dock panels can be moved to different states using built-in context menu that appears when the caption is right-clicked . Improve the end-user experience by adding custom context menu entries.

## Hide caption

Hide the visibility of a dock window caption dynamically. 

## MDI forms

The WinForms Docking Manager displays each document as a separate window within the client area. This allows users to work on more than one document at the same time and seamlessly switch back and forth between docked windows and MDI forms.

## Tab groups

The Docking Manager in Windows Forms supports grouping relevant documents into separate tab groups and allows tab group creation in both horizontal and vertical orientations. This helps users display multiple open documents, similar to MDI windows.

## Save and restore

Built-in serialization options support saving a dock layout in different formats on closing, and restoring it on opening the application.

## Complex docking layout

Visual Studio like WinForms Docking control allows users to create nested docking layouts with docked windows inside other docked windows or directly dock windows to the main form.

## Linked docking

Easily drag child windows from one docking manager to another by linking different docking managers.

## Style

The WinForms Docking Manager with a rich UI provides built-in themes like Office-style, Blend, Metro, and Visual Studio.

## Localization

The WinForms Dock control supports localization to translate static text to any supported language.

## Right to left

A right-to-left (RTL) direction setting is available for users working with languages like Hebrew, Arabic, or Persian.
